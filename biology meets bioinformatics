#This Python function, SkewArray, takes a genomic sequence Genome as input and calculates the skewness array for that sequence. 
Skewness is a measure of the relative abundance of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides along the DNA sequence :
Initializes an empty list skew with the value [0]. This list will store the skewness values for each position in the genome.
Computes the length of the genome and iterates through each nucleotide position in the genome.
At each position:
If the nucleotide is "C", it decreases the skewness value by 1 compared to the previous position and appends this new value to the skew list.
If the nucleotide is "G", it increases the skewness value by 1 compared to the previous position and appends this new value to the skew list.
If the nucleotide is neither "C" nor "G" (i.e., it's "A" or "T"), it appends the same skewness value as the previous position to the skew list.
Returns the computed skewness array.
